Elm Architecture

- Every app tends to follow the Elm architecture pattern. 
- "Great for modularity, code reuse, and testing"
- Makes code easy to pick up because it tends to be well-architected

# Three essential parts

- Model -> model function deals with application's state. 

- Update -> update function is a way to update our state. Can think of it
						as a way to process our state using functions for whatever
						your app needs to do

- View -> view function handles appearance of our app. Build structure of the view
					and can also handle events

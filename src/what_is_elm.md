What is Elm?
- Functional language that compiles to JavaScript
	- Meant for developing web apps
	- Statically typed (with type inference)
- Allows us to write well-architectured, declarative code

Why Elm?
- Make front end development simpler
- Address JavaScript fatigue
- Easy to understand and use
- Supportive community, and creator (Evan Czaplicki) active in community

Cool features of Elm
- Nice built in tools
- No runtime exceptions (i.e. null or undefined errors)
- Friendly, easy-to-read error messages in the compiler
- Immutable data 
- Functions must be pure
- Unidirectional data flow
- Centralized state
- Can describe state instead of transforming the DOM
- Built in package manager that enforces semantic versioning
	- i.e. can tell if there's a breaking change and thus not allow
	a minor version bump, but enforce a major version bump
